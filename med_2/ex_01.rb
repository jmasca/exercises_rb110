# PROBLEM #

#   - Write a program that reads the content of a text file and then prints the
#     longest sentence in the file based on number of words.
#     Sentences may end with periods (.), exclamation points (!), or question
#     marks (?).
#     Any sequence of characters that are not spaces or sentence-ending
#     characters should be treated as a word.
#     You should also print the number of words in the longest sentence.

#   input: String
#   output: String, Integer

#   rules:
#     explicit:
#       - read the contents of a text file
#       - print the sentence with the most words, and the number of words
#       - ending punctuation include `.` `!`, `?`
#       - spaces do not count, but everything else does

 ## I will come back to this problem, I don't recall learning about files. ##

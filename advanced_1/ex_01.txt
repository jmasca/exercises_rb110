It was a %{adjective} night before Christmas when
all through the house, not a %{noun} was %{verb}ing,
not even a mouse. The %{plural_noun} were all hung by the fire
with care, and we all knew %{name} soon would be there.
The %{plural_noun} were nestled all warm in their beds,
while visions of %{plural_noun} %{verb}ed in their heads.
Thats when the %{adjective} reindeer started %{verb}ing on the roof,
and out appeared %{name}, (s)he was there in a poof!
